# Automated Data Ingestion
# Automated Data Ingestion for Academic Accommodation for Students with Accessibility Needs(5051p) at University Canada West

---

### **Project Title**
**Automated Data Ingestion for Academic Accommodation Requests at UCW using AWS S3**

---

### **Project Description**
This project is part of a university-wide initiative to modernize UCWâ€™s data infrastructure supporting **academic accommodations** for students with accessibility needs. Aligned with **UCW Procedure 5051p**, this initiative introduces a fully automated and auditable system for ingesting academic accommodation records into AWS S3 using PowerShell and structured folder hierarchy.

The system is built to ensure secure, version-controlled delivery of critical datasets like **Student Information**, **Academic Accommodation Letters**, and **Appeals Information** from the operational EC2 server to a central S3-based data lake. These datasets serve multiple stakeholders including Academic Operations, Accessibility Services, and the Registrarâ€™s Office. This process forms the first step in a broader academic data pipeline supporting compliance, analytics, and service improvement.

---

### **Objective**
The core objective is to establish a secure, consistent, and metadata-tagged ingestion mechanism to automate the transfer of CSV datasets to the AWS S3 data lake. The pipeline supports traceability, temporal classification (by year/quarter/month), and reliable correlation across academic records via shared identifiers (e.g., `StudentID`).

### **1. Data Storgae in S3**

Each dataset is ingested using precise versioned folder keys that track origin, year, quarter, and upload server. This structure supports auditing, retention management, and future pipeline extensibility.
- Created Folders inside S3 raw bucket.
- Ingestion of each dataset is defined based on their access patterns.
  /accomodation/student-information-list/year=2025/quarter=1/server-AGVS-My
  /accomodation/academic-accomodation-letter-list/year=2025/quarter=1/month=1/server-AGVS-My
  /accomodation/appeal-information-list/year=2025/quarter=1/month=1/server-AGVS-My

---

### **2. Ingestion Process**
- Created EC2 Instance named AGVS-My
- Chose Windows AMI and t3.micro instance type (2 CPU, 1 GiB Memory)
- Used Vockey Key Pair for encryption
- Configured RDP access for remote connection
- Generated username, password and public DNS to connect to the sample virtual server created for UCW Academics Opeartion team
- Used 'Windows App' to connect to the remote virtual server using the pre generated credentials
- The ingestion process is implemented through PowerShell scripts run on an EC2 instance, utilizing the `Write-S3Object` command to upload CSV files directly to S3 with custom key naming.
