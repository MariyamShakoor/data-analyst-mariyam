# Data Lake Security Implementation

## Project Title:  
**Data Lake Security Implementation for Academic Accommodation for Students with Accessibility Needs(5051p) at UCW**

---

## Objective:  
To protect the data lake from CIA threats and implement a secure academic data lake that stores, organizes, and governs sensitive student-related datasetsâ€”such as accommodation letters in the UCW's policy of Academic Accommodation for Students with Accessibility Needs using AWS S3 with built-in encryption, versioning, and replication to ensure privacy, integrity, and availability.

---

## Background:  
University Canada West manages sensitive academic information including accessibility accommodations and appeal records. To support compliance and data lifecycle management, a multi-layered data lake architecture was implemented using AWS S3 buckets, with security features such as **KMS encryption**, **version control**, and **cross-bucket replication** for disaster recovery and traceability.

## Methodology:

### Data Lake Architecture

Three S3 buckets were provisioned to represent raw, transformed, and curated layers of the academic data lake:

- **Bucket 1: `academics-raw-my`**  
  - Stores unprocessed, original data files.
  - **Security Features**:  
    - AWS **KMS encryption** enabled for data-at-rest  
    - **Versioning** enabled to maintain change history  
    - **Replication rules** configured for redundancy  

- **Bucket 2: `academics-trf-my`**  
  - Stores datasets after transformation (e.g., cleaned schema).
  - **Security Features**:  
    - AWS **KMS encryption** enabled for data-at-rest  
    - **Versioning** enabled to maintain change history  
    - **Replication rules** configured for redundancy

  - **Bucket 3: academics-cur-my**
  - Stores curated, final datasets ready for querying or analysis.
  - **Security Features**:
    - AWS **KMS encryption** enabled for data-at-rest  
    - **Versioning** enabled to maintain change history  
    - **Replication rules** configured for redundancy

### Data Management Steps:
1. Ingest raw CSV files into academics-raw-my  
2. Transform data using AWS Glue DataBrew   
3. Output transformed files to academics-trf-my  
4. Store final curated versions in academics-cur-my for access by downstream services
   
### Data Lake Security Implementation

1. **Encryption**  
   - All three buckets use AWS **Key Management Service (KMS)** to encrypt files at rest.
   - Created a **symmetric key** using **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**.
   - Assigned administrative and usage permissions to IAM role `LabRole`.

2. **Versioning**  
   - Enabled to maintain previous versions of all files, protecting against accidental deletion or overwrites.

3. **Replication**  
   - Configured S3 replication rules to duplicate data across buckets or regions for durability and disaster recovery.

4. **Access Management**  
   - IAM roles and policies (e.g., LabRole) assigned to control who can read/write to each bucket.

5. **Data Lifecycle**  
   - Data transitions from `raw` to `transformed` to `curated` layers, ensuring separation of duties and controlled access at each stage.
