# Migration of UCW to AWS Cloud
# Project 1: Automated Data Ingestion for Academic Accommodation for Students with Accessibility Needs at UCW (5051 p)


---

## Objective
To automate and standardize the ingestion, profiling, and management of academic accommodation datasets for students with accessibility needs, aligned with UCW Procedure 5051p. The project enhances data quality, governance, and accessibility for administrative decision-making and compliance tracking.

---

## Datasets Used
- **Student_Information_List.csv** ‚Äì Contains basic student information.
- **Academic_Accommodation_Letter_Dataset.csv** ‚Äì Holds accommodation implementation status by student.
- **Appeals_Information_Dataset.csv** ‚Äì Records accommodation-related appeal types.

---

## Methodology
### 1. Data Upload & Organization
- Used PowerShell with `Write-S3Object` to upload datasets into structured Amazon S3 buckets.
- Followed naming convention:
  ```
  accomodation/<list-type>/year=2025/quarter=01/month=1/server=AGVS-My/
  ```

### 2. Cloud Storage & Access Control
- Stored all datasets in Amazon S3.
- Ensured data traceability and security using key naming standards.

### 3. Schema Mapping
- Established relationships:
  - `StudentID` as primary key across all datasets
  - Accommodation and appeals linked with one-to-one or one-to-many references

### 4. Data Architecture
- Centralized infrastructure in EC2 + VPC environment (AGVS-My)
- Access given to:
  - Academic Operations Team
  - Data Analytics Team

# Project 2: üßπ Data Wrangling for Academic Accommodations (Procedure 5051p)

## Project Title  
**Data Wrangling for Academic Accommodation and Appeal Records Using AWS (Procedure 5051p Compliance)**

## Project Description  
This project focuses on comprehensive data wrangling to clean, transform, and unify academic accommodation and appeal records for students with accessibility needs, in compliance with **Procedure 5051p**. Leveraging AWS services such as S3, Glue DataBrew, Athena, and Glue Catalog, the objective is to create a reliable, analysis-ready dataset that supports institutional decision-making, compliance reporting, and student service optimization.

---

## Objective  
The primary goal of this project is to perform data profiling, cleaning, and transformation across multiple CSV and TXT datasets related to student accommodations, appeals, and system logs. The final output is a consolidated, high-quality dataset that reflects accurate records for accessibility services and supports downstream analytics, including equity audits and policy planning.

---

## Background  
Academic institutions are expected to maintain precise, transparent records for students requiring academic accommodations. However, this data often resides in fragmented files or databases, leading to inconsistencies and data quality issues. This project directly supports **Procedure 5051p: Academic Accommodation for Students with Accessibility Needs**, ensuring that accommodation and appeal data is reliable, accessible, and actionable through cloud-based wrangling practices.

## Dataset Description  

| Dataset Name                     | Description                                                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `StudentInformationList.csv`     | Basic student records with IDs and names                     |
| `AcademicAccommodationsList.csv` | Accommodation types and implementation status               |
| `AppealsInformationList.csv`     | Appeal IDs, types, and linked student IDs                    |
| `AccommodationUserLog.txt`       | Raw log of user access to the accommodation platform         |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection**  
- Upload CSV and TXT files to Amazon S3 (`academics-raw-my` bucket)  
- Define folder structure by file type, server, and timestamp  
- Enable lifecycle rules for archival in Glacier Instant Retrieval  

### 2. **Data Assessment**  
- Use AWS Glue DataBrew for initial profiling  
- Review for missing values, duplicate rows, incorrect formats, and type mismatches  
- Document column types, key fields, and invalid entries  

### 3. **Data Cleaning**  
- Remove duplicate entries  
- Impute or handle missing values appropriately  
- Standardize column formats (dates, text casing, etc.)  
- Normalize categorical values (e.g., appeal status = Active/Closed)  

### 4. **Data Transformation**  
- Convert date strings to datetime objects  
- Derive new fields such as:
  - `AccommodationDuration`
  - `AppealStatusFlag`  
- Aggregate logs for access count per student  

### 5. **Data Consolidation**  
- Join datasets using `StudentID`, `AppealID`, and `RecordDate` as keys  
- Create a unified master dataset for institutional reporting and analysis  

### 6. **Documentation and Validation**  
- Record all transformation steps via Glue DataBrew recipes  
- Validate final dataset using exploratory analysis in Athena  
- Create data quality summary matrix (Invalid, Outdated, Outliers, Missing, Type Issues)
