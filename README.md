These projects represent a progressive series of learning and practical implementation as part of the Cloud Computing Technologies course during my MBA at University Canada West, conducted under the supervision of Dr. Mahmood Mortazavi Dehkordi. Each phase reflects a hands-on application of cloud-native tools to address real-world data management challenges in academic and municipal domains, reinforcing both technical proficiency and strategic thinking in cloud-based architecture and data governance.

# [Project 1: Descriptive Analysis at City of Vancouver](./Project%201/)
This project conducted a descriptive analysis of City of Vancouver’s2024 Multi-Year Capital Project Budget requests and Capital Expenditure Budget using AWS Glue DataBrew, uncovering trends in funding allocations, service category distributions, and community priorities. Key insights included a high volume of requests for Parks & Public Spaces, strong budget correlations, and high data quality, supporting informed financial planning and resource prioritization. 
# [Project 2: Data Wrangling at City of Vancouver](./Project%205/)
The project focused on cleaning and transforming the 2024 Capital Project Budget dataset for the City of Vancouver using AWS Glue DataBrew, addressing issues like missing values, inconsistent formats, and redundant categories. The cleaned data was output in CSV and partitioned Parquet formats, enabling efficient querying and analysis from a standardized, validated S3-based data lake structure.
# [Project 3: Phase 2 of Data Analytics Platform (DAP) at City of Vancouver](./Project%202/)
The forst phase of the project involved data ingestion, descriptive analysis, data wrangling and ETL summarization. This project shows the phase 2 which enhanced the City of Vancouver’s AWS-based Data Analytics Platform by implementing diagnostic queries in Athena, S3 encryption with AWS KMS, and data governance through Glue Studio-based quality checks. Real-time monitoring via CloudWatch and secured log tracking through CloudTrail further ensured reliable, cost-effective, and policy-driven management of capital budget data.
# [Project 4: Automated Data Ingestion at University Canada West](./Project%203/)
This project establishes a secure and version-controlled automated data ingestion system for academic accommodation records at UCW using AWS S3 and PowerShell on EC2, aligned with Procedure 5051p. It enables traceable, policy-compliant data transfer and centralized access to student, accommodation, and appeals datasets—laying the foundation for scalable analytics and service improvements.
# [Project 5: Data Lake Security Implementation at University Canada West](./Project%204/)
This project implemented a secure, compliant academic data lake for UCW using AWS S3, with KMS encryption, versioning, and replication across raw, transformed, and curated layers to protect sensitive accommodation data. The architecture ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of student records, aligning with Procedure 5051p and enabling future-ready academic data governance.
# [Project 6: AWS Data Lake Architecture with Glue-based ETL and Cataloging at University Canada West](./Project%205/)
This project established a scalable AWS data lake for academic accommodation records at UCW, integrating Glue-based ETL pipelines, Data Catalogs, and S3 partitioning strategies aligned with Procedure 5051p. The architecture also incorporates Elastic Beanstalk for log ingestion and monitoring, enabling secure, structured, and analytics-ready data infrastructure for accessibility services and academic governance.
